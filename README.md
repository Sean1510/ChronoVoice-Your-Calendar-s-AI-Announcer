2. **Automate Like a Pro**

  **⚙️ Set hourly reminders effortlessly:**

  - The workflow uses 24 silent automations (one for each hour of the day) to check your calendar.
  
  - Why 24? The Find Calendar Events action scans for events starting "in the next 1 hour". By scheduling triggers at 12:00 AM, 1:00 AM, ..., 11:00 PM, you’ll never miss a beat!

  - **🔧 Customize it:**

  -- Prefer fewer triggers? Adjust the condition in Find Calendar Events (e.g., "Start Date is in the next 2 hours") and reduce automations to 12 total (every 2 hours).

  -- Enable "Run Immediately" for instant, notification-free execution.
